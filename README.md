In this project let's create a simple car racing game. This will be a breeze for you
as you have made much more difficult games.
This car game won’t be a real time game. JUST one PC(playable character) and
multiple NPC’s(non playable characters).
Your game must have a car that the user controls. The objective of the game is to
dodge all the cars coming from ahead without touching the other cars.
Use the concepts of Object Oriented Programming to create classes for Player,
Car, Road, Score…
You can make the game more interesting by giving the user 5 lives. Everytime the
player touches the cars coming from ahead reduces the score by a set number of
points.
Create a repository on GitHub and send the link to your repository on your student
dashboard.
